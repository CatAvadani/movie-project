## Description

The Movie Showcase App is an application designed to mimic the core functionalities of a streaming platform like Netflix. This project served as an opportunity to put into practice and deepen my understanding of Next.js, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and Firebase Authentication, including its server-side rendering capabilities, routing system, and overall React framework enhancements. By developing this app, I have gained hands-on experience with modern web development techniques and a better grasp of user interface design principles. Users of the app can enjoy a seamless browsing experience with dynamically loaded movie categories, detailed views of movie banners, and a rich interface similar to commercial streaming services.
